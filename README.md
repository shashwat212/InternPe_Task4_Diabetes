# Diabetes Prediction System

A machine learning project developed during the **AI/ML Internship at InternPe**, designed to implement an **end-to-end machine learning workflow** — from data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, to final prediction.  
The model predicts whether a person is **diabetic or non-diabetic** based on medical data and input features.

## Overview

The project focuses on:

- Working with real-world medical data  
- Preprocessing datasets for effective model training  
- Implementing **Logistic Regression** for binary classification  
- Performing **train-test split** for accurate evaluation  
- Displaying model accuracy clearly  
- Predicting diabetes outcomes based on user input values  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
- **Approach:** Machine Learning (Classification)

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Understand dataset patterns and distributions  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Normalize and clean numerical features  
   - Prepare dataset for ML training  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression used as the primary classification model  
   - Train-test split ensures reliable evaluation  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy Score  
   - Observing correct vs incorrect predictions  
   - Understanding model performance with medical inputs  

5. **Prediction**  
   - Model predicts whether a person is:  
     - **Diabetic (1)**  
     - **Non-Diabetic (0)**
